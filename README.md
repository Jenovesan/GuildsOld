### My first attempt at a guilds plugin for a Minecraft server

## Note
This was my first attempt at creating a guilds plugin for a Minecraft server where players could create and join guilds to play together.  
I eventually started working on a difrerent project, but a few months later became reinterested in this project. 
But during my absense of working on this project I learned a lot about proper OOP.  
With my new knowledge of OOP and knowing that this codebase could not sustain massive growth, I decided to restart this project.
That project is my Guilds repository.
